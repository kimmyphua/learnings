/*An array A consisting of N integers is given. A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if it is possible to build a triangle with sides of lengths A[P], A[Q] and A[R]. In other words, triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if 0 â‰¤ P < Q < R < N and:

A[P] + A[Q] > A[R],
A[Q] + A[R] > A[P],
A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].
For example, consider array A such that:

  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 12
There are four triangular triplets that can be constructed from elements of this array, namely (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (0, 4, 5), and (2, 4, 5).

Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of triangular triplets in this array.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 12
the function should return 4, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..1,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].*/

function solution(A) {
 const n = A.length;
 A.sort((a, b) => a - b);
 // 1,2,5,8,10,12
 let count = 0;

 for (let i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
  let j = i + 1; //second element
  let k = i + 2; //third element
  console.log("A[i], count --------------", A[i], count);
  while (j < n - 1) {
   if (k < n && A[i] + A[j] > A[k]) {
    console.log("if k i j", k, i, j);
    //j maybe be = to k but will cancel out in k-j
    //if condition is satisfied keep adding to count (triangles)
    k++;
   } else {
    console.log("else k i j", k, i, j);
    j++;
    count += k - j;
    console.log("k-j", k - j, count);
   }
  }
 }
 return count;
}

console.log(solution([10, 2, 5, 1, 8, 12]));
